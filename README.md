### !! These styles seem to have stopped working in the latest darktable version !!

I just noticed a topic on pixls that mentioned these styles not working any longer when using darktable 3.9.0 and I can confirm this being the case. There's also mention that this is the case for earlier darktable version when using Windows. I'm not able to confirm this due to not having access to Windows.

I'm not sure yet if a solution is available and if so how easy it would be to implement. That combined with these styles not being scene-referred safe, which doesn't have to be a problem in and of itself, might make me to conclude that these styles stay available as-is or are taken down completely. I'll have to tjink about this for a bit.....
