# dt.styles

A large collection of styles for darktable. Set up in a hierarchical way.


Added a Black & White section. There are no new files in this section, the relevant B&W files are taken form the brand related sections. They are renamed (stripped the brand name) and the xml layout has been checked and fixed where needed. 

Next step: A dedicated Colour section
