# dt.styles

A large collection of styles for darktable. Set up in a hierarchical way.

The Black & White section houses the same, B&W, files as present in the brand related sections. The are renamed (stripped the brand name) and the xml has been checked and fixed where needed.

 This is the first step to create dedicated B&W and Colour sections.
