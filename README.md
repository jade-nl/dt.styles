         Agfa
             Vista 200
```

darkroom view:

The "styles" in the Personal section are basically preset back-ups. 

### Just a heads up about these styles

These styles are rather old and as such come with possible side effects that you might not like or at least need to be aware of.

Some of these styles use modules that are outside of darktable's default scene-referred workflow or uses deprecated modules. 2 examples are the use of the *tonecurve* module (out of scope for scene referred) and the use of the *channelmixer*, deprecated in favour of the *color calibration* module.

This does not mean that these styles cannot be used any longer, they certainly can, but you do need to be aware that this happens.

These are styles and not LUTS, so when a style is applied the modules are activated and can be dealt with if needed.
